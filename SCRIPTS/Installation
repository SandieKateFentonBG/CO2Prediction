1. Install Anaconda: Download and install Anaconda from the link below (choose
the right version for your OS):
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

2. Open anaconda command prompt

3. Create new anaconda environment named ’ml labs’:
(conda create −−name ml_labs #for latest pandas version)
conda create −−name ml_labs python=3.8 #for specific python version

4. (Optional) Enter the newly created environment:
conda activate ml_labs

5. Install required packages by sequentially executing:

conda install numpy=1.19.2
conda install scikit−learn=0.23.2
conda install matplotlib=3.3.4
conda install notebook=6.2.0

To check if the installation was correctly executed, you can try to import the installed
libraries in a Python script. This can be easily done as follows:

import numpy
import matplotlib
import sklearn
